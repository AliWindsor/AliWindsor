-  Hi, Iâ€™m @AliWindsor :D
-  Interested in iOS application design/development.
-  Completely self taught in iOS developer, making use of different sources to master the basicis of what goes into creating an app.
-  Mainly use Swift (I hope to learn Objective-C one day) and for UIs I prefer SwiftUI, but I know how to use UIKit :)
-  Recent BSc Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence Graduate (2:1) from Brunel University.
-  Swapped over to iOS development because its more fun for me and I don't get to design UIs working with ML models :P
